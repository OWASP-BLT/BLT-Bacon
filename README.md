## BLT Bacon Coin

The BLT bacon coin is a digital token that serves as a reward system for bug hunters who find and report issues on the BLT bug logging tool, flutter app, or chrome extension. The token is based on the Ethereum POA (Proof of Authority) network and is not intended for investment or selling purposes. Instead, it is used solely as a reward system that can be traded.

Bug hunters who find issues on the BLT bug logging tool, flutter app, or chrome extension will be rewarded with BLT bacon coins. The amount of BLT bacon coins rewarded will depend on the severity of the issue found. The more severe the issue, the higher the reward.

The BLT bacon coin will be closely integrated with the BLT bug logging tool, flutter app, and chrome extension. This integration will allow for seamless reward distribution to bug hunters who report issues. The token will also be tradable, which means that bug hunters can trade their rewards with others.

Additionally, people can donate their BLT bacon tokens to one another. This feature allows individuals to show appreciation for someone's hard work and dedication in finding and reporting issues.
