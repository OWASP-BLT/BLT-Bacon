## Blockchain Assisted Contribution Network #2588


BACON is designed as a Bitcoin-based token system that rewards engagement and contributions within the BLT ecosystem. Below, we outline how key features of BACON will integrate with Bitcoin Core, Runes, and the BLT platform's existing infrastructure:

Incentivized GitHub Issue Resolution:

Minting and Rewarding: BACON tokens will be minted as rewards when users report issues via the BLT bug logging tool. These tokens, created using the Runes protocol on Bitcoin, will be fungible and can be traded or used within the BLT ecosystem. The system, based on a Proof of Authority (POA) consensus mechanism, ensures that rewards are distributed transparently and fairly. Developers who resolve issues will earn BACON tokens, creating a gamified environment that promotes rapid and effective problem-solving【21†source】【24†source】.
Trademark Monitoring and Early Alerts:

Blockchain Integration: The trademark monitoring feature will continuously scan newly registered trademarks via the USPTO database, comparing them against a company’s registered terms or domain names. When a potential conflict is detected, the system, backed by blockchain technology, triggers alerts to notify the company. The integration with Bitcoin ensures that all monitoring activities are logged securely and immutably, providing a tamper-proof audit trail that helps companies protect their intellectual property【22†source】.
Company Scoreboard:

Blockchain-Backed Transparency: The BLT platform will include a scoreboard that ranks companies based on their responsiveness to reported issues. This ranking data will be secured on the blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin’s transparency and immutability to ensure that the rankings are accurate and resistant to tampering. Companies with the best scores will be publicly recognized, encouraging them to maintain high standards of responsiveness and quality in their open-source contributions【25†source】.
Runes Protocol for Token Issuance:

Fungible Tokens on Bitcoin: Using the Runes protocol, BACON tokens will be issued directly on Bitcoin. This allows them to be fungible and easily transferable within the BLT ecosystem, including through the iOS app. The Runes protocol integration ensures that BACON tokens can be used across different applications within BLT, offering a seamless experience for users whether they are earning, trading, or spending their tokens【23†source】【24†source】.
New Bitcoin Developments and Integration:

Leveraging Bitcoin Core Enhancements: BACON will integrate with the latest developments in Bitcoin Core, focusing on improvements that enhance transaction efficiency, scalability, and security. Key features such as Schnorr signatures, Taproot, and Lightning Network integration will be utilized to ensure that BACON transactions are not only secure and private but also cost-effective and scalable. These advancements align with OWASP's mission to promote secure software and reliable transaction processes within the ecosystem【23†source】.
BLT Mobile Integration:

iOS App Functionality: The BLT iOS app will fully integrate with BACON and the Runes protocol, allowing users to manage their tokens, track their contributions, and monitor their standings on the company scoreboard. The app will also support notifications for trademark alerts, issue bounties, and other platform activities, keeping users engaged and informed while on the move【24†source】.
Ensuring OWASP Compliance:
To maintain alignment with OWASP's principles, BACON’s integration into BLT will strictly adhere to the following guidelines:

Compliance with OWASP’s Non-Profit Status:

All financial activities involving BACON, including token minting, trading, and rewards, will directly support OWASP’s mission of improving software security. This includes transparent use of funds for security initiatives, educational programs, and community support【21†source】.
Transparency and Accountability:

Utilizing Bitcoin’s blockchain ensures that all BACON-related transactions are recorded in a public ledger, facilitating transparent audits and ensuring compliance with OWASP’s objectives. This will provide the community with visibility into how funds are managed and used【23†source】.
Adherence to OWASP’s Sponsorship and Funding Guidelines:

BACON will maintain OWASP’s values by avoiding conflicts of interest and ensuring that sponsorships or donations do not influence the direction of the project inappropriately. The platform will diversify its funding sources to maintain neutrality and independence, ensuring that all contributions are used to support open-source security initiatives【21†source】【23†source】.
