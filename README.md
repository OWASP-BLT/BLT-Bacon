## 🚀 Key Features and Integration Points

### 1. Incentivized GitHub Issue Resolution
   - **Minting and Rewarding**: BACON tokens are minted as rewards when users report issues via the BLT bug logging tool. These tokens, created using the Runes protocol on Bitcoin, are fungible and can be traded or utilized within the BLT ecosystem.
   - **Proof of Authority (POA) Consensus**: The system uses a POA mechanism to ensure transparent and fair distribution of rewards, encouraging rapid and effective problem-solving.
   - **Developer Rewards**: Developers who resolve issues earn BACON tokens, creating a gamified environment that boosts productivity and engagement.

### 2. Trademark Monitoring and Early Alerts
   - **Blockchain Integration**: The trademark monitoring feature continuously scans newly registered trademarks via the USPTO database, compares them against a company’s registered terms or domain names, and triggers alerts when potential conflicts are detected.
   - **Tamper-Proof Audit Trail**: All monitoring activities are logged securely and immutably on the blockchain, helping companies protect their intellectual property.

### 3. Company Scoreboard
   - **Blockchain-Backed Transparency**: A scoreboard that ranks companies based on their responsiveness to reported issues. This data is secured on the blockchain, ensuring accurate, tamper-resistant rankings.
   - **Public Recognition**: Companies with the best scores are publicly recognized, motivating them to maintain high standards in their open-source contributions.

### 4. Runes Protocol for Token Issuance
   - **Fungible Tokens on Bitcoin**: BACON tokens, issued directly on Bitcoin using the Runes protocol, are fungible and easily transferable within the BLT ecosystem, including via the BLT iOS app.
   - **Seamless User Experience**: The Runes protocol integration ensures BACON tokens can be used across different applications within BLT, whether earning, trading, or spending them.

### 5. New Bitcoin Developments and Integration
   - **Leveraging Bitcoin Core Enhancements**: BACON integrates with the latest Bitcoin Core developments, including Schnorr signatures, Taproot, and Lightning Network, to ensure transactions are secure, private, cost-effective, and scalable.
   - **Aligning with OWASP's Mission**: These enhancements support OWASP's commitment to secure software and reliable transaction processes within the BLT ecosystem.

### 6. BLT Mobile Integration
   - **iOS App Functionality**: The BLT iOS app fully integrates with BACON and the Runes protocol, allowing users to manage tokens, track contributions, and monitor their standings on the company scoreboard.
   - **Engagement on the Go**: The app also supports notifications for trademark alerts, issue bounties, and other platform activities, keeping users informed and engaged wherever they are.

## 📲 Slack Integration

### `/distribute` Command

The `/distribute` command allows you to distribute BACON tokens to a specified user in Slack. This command is handled by a Slack bot that interacts with the BACON system.

### Usage

To distribute BACON tokens, use the following command in Slack:

```
/distribute <amount> bacon @<user>
```

### Example

To distribute 10 BACON tokens to a user with the Slack handle `@user`, type the following command in Slack:

```
/distribute 10 bacon @user
```

The Slack bot will process the command and distribute the specified amount of BACON tokens to the user.
